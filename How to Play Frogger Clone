## How to Play
Use the arrows on your keyboard to move the boy character up, down, left and right. 
The goal is to reach the water without being touched by any of the insects crossing the road. 
When you've reached the water, the boy will be reset back to where you started from to try again. 
If you run into an enemy, the game will reset and you can start all over.
